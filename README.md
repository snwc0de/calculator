# calculator
This project involves the development of an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project would contain all of the basic math operators you typically find on calculators:
1. add (+)
2. subtract (-)
3. multiply (/)
4. divide (*)

This file would be updated gradually as the project is in development.
